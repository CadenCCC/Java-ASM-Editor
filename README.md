# Java-ASM-Editor
### Reason
Basically I was bored and annoyed with all Java Debugging tools (also annoyed with <a href="https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin">Mixins</a>).
<p>
More Information with this project will come but in simple terms, making debugging Java rats 1000x easier.
I will also include a "Java Checker". That program will check jar files for you to make sure it is safe.
</p>
<p>
This project is a work in progress expect real changes in like 10 days or however it takes
</p>

### Mixins
If you can't already tell I HATE Mixins. It's a great idea, but it's a clear separator in the Modding community of Minecraft.
<p>
So I want to make a Universal Mixins Substitute, I will list all of my issues with Mixins as the days continue.
Currently I am making a debugging tool and ASM API out of this.
